# RB-OKVS

RB-OKVS (Random Band Oblivious Key-Value Stores) is an interesting structure that can encode a key-value data into a vector based on random band matrices. This repository contains a simple implementation for RB-OKVS based on Python. For the details of RB-OKVS, please refer to the paper [Near-Optimal Oblivious Key-Value Stores for Efficient PSI, PSU and Volume-Hiding Multi-Maps](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/903)
